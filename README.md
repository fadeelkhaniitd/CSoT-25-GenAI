## What is CAIC Summer of Tech?  
CAIC Summer of Tech is a 5-week program by the Co-curricular and Academic Interaction Council (CAIC), built to help students—especially freshers—explore tech without the pressure. Whether you're completely new or just starting out, this is your launchpad.

Inspired by Inter-IIT Tech Meet problem statements, the initiative offers guided tracks in cool domains like Gen AI, CS research, Cybersecurity, Quant, and many more. Each track includes:  
- **Bite-sized weekly content**  
- **Beginner-friendly projects**  
- **Mentorship and support from seniors**  

> **No prior experience? No stress.**  
> This program is designed to make sure you learn while building, not before. The goal isn’t to be perfect — it’s to start.

## Problem Statement (Gen AI)

### Brief Background  
Generative AI is shaping how we build smart tools—from chatbots to personal tutors. In this track, you'll explore how these systems work under the hood. Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer questions, summarize content, and even reason—but they often hallucinate when they don't have access to reliable information. That’s where **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) comes in. RAG systems combine LLMs with your own data sources, improving factual accuracy and control.

In this track, starting from basic API calls and prompting techniques, you’ll gradually move towards powerful frameworks like **LangChain** and concepts like RAG. The final goal? Build your own **Case Prep Bot** that can smartly fetch and respond with relevant content—like your own mini-ChatGPT trained on a custom dataset.

### How Will It Work?  
This 5-week Gen AI track includes:  
- **Weekly lessons**  
- **Coding challenges**  
- A hands-on **Problem Statement (PS)**: building a custom GenAI case-prep bot  

You’ll move from simple prompt chaining to full-fledged RAG architecture. Each week builds on the last, with concepts released gradually. You’ll learn just enough theory to stay oriented, but the focus is on **practical system-building**.

### Final Goal  
Implement a functional conversational bot using a RAG pipeline built over a custom dataset (provided mid-track), capable of answering case-prep queries with context-awareness and minimal hallucination.
